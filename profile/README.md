# Welcome to the Neo4j PHP Community!

This GitHub organization serves as a hub for community-developed tools and libraries that empower PHP developers to work with Neo4j, the world's leading graph database.

**Important Note:** While Neo4j provides technical support to the community for developing these tools and libraries, **we do not offer official support for the PHP environment itself**. This means that while we'll do our best to help you, we may not be able to provide direct troubleshooting or issue resolution.

However, don't let that discourage you! This vibrant community is full of passionate developers who are dedicated to building high-quality tools and supporting each other.

## Getting Started:

- **New to Neo4j?** Start with Neo4j's official documentation: https://neo4j.com/docs/
- **Need help with a specific tool?** Open an issue in the corresponding repository.
- **Want to contribute?** We welcome your contributions! See the contribution guidelines in each repository.
- **Join the community discussions!** Engage with fellow PHP developers using Neo4j in the Neo4j Community Forum: https://community.neo4j.com/

**We are excited to have you join the Neo4j PHP community!** We believe in the power of collaboration and open source, and we are committed to supporting you in your journey with Neo4j.
